# Supabase via MCP

In this project, **always use the Supabase MCP server first** for any Supabase-related work before suggesting manual steps to the user.

- **Migrations**: Use the MCP `apply_migration` tool to apply migrations to the linked Supabase project. Do not tell the user to run migrations manually unless MCP is unavailable or fails.
- **SQL / schema**: Prefer MCP tools (`execute_sql`, `apply_migration`, `list_migrations`, `list_tables`, etc.) to verify or change the database.
- **Types**: Use `generate_typescript_types` if you need to refresh DB types.

Only suggest manual steps (e.g. "run this in the Supabase SQL Editor") if the MCP server is not available or returns an error that cannot be resolved via MCP.
